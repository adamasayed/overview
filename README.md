## Projects
Adam Sayed's Project Overview

### Full Stack Work

I expanded a frontend webpage, using an AngularJS framework, and creating new API calls to a C# microservice backend. The microservice retrieved information from and modified a SQL database, sending data to the user, which simplified access to information and streamlined company workflow.

### Neural Network

Formula-based backpropagation Neural Network made from scratch in Java with no external libraries. Fully customizable for any data training set and network specification. Tested on determining how many fingers a hand is holding up based on training images of the hand. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/adamasayed/NeuralNetwork)

### Cancer Cell Classifier

Uses ML techniques like Convolutional Layers and dropout to form one model, and then a random forest classifier to form another. 5 sets of 5,000 cancer cell images are classified as easy or hard cases by the models, and then classified by the random forest if they are easier to identify and vice versa.

### AAFSG

AAFSG is an online seed finder that looks for good seeds for Minecraft All Advancements Speedruns using code to predict Java random calls. The filter looks through millions of seeds to see how the world will generate, and predicts one that will be useful. You can find the filter's website at [aafsg.com](https://aafsg.com)

The repository that powers the project can be found [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/AAFSG)

## Seedfinding Tutorial

In-depth beginner friendly [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFKxh8Rfjx8) to learn how to start seedfinding yourself!



### Item Finder

A Tool that finds the closest of an item on a given minecraft seed. If you want to scout a seed, cope check, or just know where a given item is, check it out.

Project link can be found here with new releases coming out soon [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/ItemFinder)

### AA-Coop Tracker

This is a tracker for All Advancements Coop Speedruns that you can install on your server to track advancements.

The project can be found [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/AA-Coop-Tracker)

### MC Resetting Server

Collaborations on a project to create code for a web server to create a server that can reset using in game /stop. This allows the player to reset much faster than having to go to the game files, stop the game, delete the world files, and relaunch. If interested in speedrunning using AWS or GCP servers, this is a good addition.
